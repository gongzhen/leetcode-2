My LeetCode solutions
=========

This repo contains my solutions to the problems of [LeetCode](http://oj.leetcode.com/), an online judge platform for preparing technical coding interviews.
The problem statements can be found [here](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/).
All the solutions are written in Java.

Organization
------------

The solutions to a given problem are put in a separate folder with the name of the ID of that problem.
For most of the problems, there is a single solution in a file named `Solution.java`.
For some problems, there exist multiple solutions in files `Solution_<method>.java`, where `<method>` is a descriptive keyword to distinguish different approaches.

Some problems use custom structs.
The definitions of these structs as classes are originally given in the code template as comments at the top.
I removed them to keep my codes cleaner.
(I seldom put comments in my code unless truly necessary)
Instead, I put all the definition classes in the folder `util/`.
This also makes it easier for local debugging.

Contributions
----------------

Some of my solutions may not be optimal in either memory or time efficiency.
If you have found a better solution to any problems, you are welcome to post your solution by making a pull request.
I will merge it into the repo with full attribution once I have them reviewed.
